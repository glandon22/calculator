My attempt at a calculator app using JavaScript and standard HTML/CSS. JS code is a bit hacky but displays normal functionality. Dividing
by zero returns NaN but I have left that feature in there. 

Users are able to perform addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication to both integers and floating point numbers. Calc throws
and error when screen overflows or other user errors. Operations can be chained together, or cleared out, as per normal handheld calcs.
